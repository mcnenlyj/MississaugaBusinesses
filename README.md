# MississaugaBusinesses
This is my Github repository for the CIND 820 Capstone Project "The effect of Covid in the early stages on Mississauga businesses". This is a private 
Github repository and can be found at https://github.com/mcnenlyj/MississaugaBusinesses.  I have uploaded the relevant Microsoft Word, Excel, html and pdf 
files.  All coding files are in Python.
As of February 21, 2023 you will find my revised abstract, literature review, EDA reports and data structure.
