# MississaugaBusinesses
This is my Github repository for the CIND 820 Capstone Project "The effect of Covid in the early stages on Mississauga businesses". This is a private 
Github repository and can be found at https://github.com/mcnenlyj/MississaugaBusinesses.  I have uploaded the relevant Microsoft Word, Excel, html and pdf 
files.  All coding files are in Python.

As of March 13, 2023 you will find my code in the <b>04-Code folder</b>.  I have also uploaded a revised data structure table in that folder and noted where I transformed files.  

The results of the businesses that were most / least affected by the pandemic somewhat matches the studies I looked at.  I have noted in the file 2021CleanDataset which businesses these were and can go into detail in the next stage of the project.  I think that is interesting. Some industries, like mining or forestry were not industries you would expect to find in a city, so that discrepency with some of the studies can be explained.  

My feature analysis and prediction did not produce good results.  There were no consistent attributes within the dataset that predicted if a business would survive or not.  The models were better at predicting is businesses did not close but even then the results were in the low 80s.
